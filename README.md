# ðŸ›‘ Traffic Light Detection using OpenCV

## Description

This project detects traffic light states (**RED, YELLOW, GREEN**) in **images, videos, and live webcam feeds** using **Python** and **OpenCV**. It uses color segmentation in the HSV color space and contour detection to identify and classify traffic lights in real-time.

You can also **view a deployed demo** of this project using **Streamlit**.

## Features

* Detect traffic lights in **real-time via webcam**.
* Process **video files** for traffic light detection.
* Test using **static images**.
* Shows bounding boxes around detected traffic lights.
* Displays the current traffic light state (`RED`, `YELLOW`, `GREEN`, or `UNKNOWN`).

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3.13**
* **OpenCV** for computer vision
* **NumPy** for numerical operations
* **Streamlit** (for web deployment)
